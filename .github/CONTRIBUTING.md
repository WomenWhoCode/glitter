# Contributing

- We use the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) branching strategy here. The `master` branch is our production release branch, and the `staging` branch is our integration and development branch. Any work you do should be on a feature branch from `staging`.
- Submit a pull request for your work and a reviewer will get back to you soon.
- Merge your work back to `staging` when complete!
