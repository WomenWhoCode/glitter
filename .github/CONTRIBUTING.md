- Please don't fork! :fork_and_knife:
- We use the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) branching strategy here. The `master` branch is our production release branch, and the `staging` branch is our integration and development branch. Any work you do should be on a feature branch from `staging`.
- Do you have questions? You are welcome to mention @WomenWhoCode/glitter-reviews in your issue for help. 
- Submit a pull request for your work. Make sure to fill in all the sections of the Pull Request template, including steps for QA and any notes or gotchas. The team @WomenWhoCode/glitter-reviews should be tagged so they know to review your new PR.
- We'll merge your work back to `staging` when approved!
