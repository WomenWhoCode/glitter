# Adding to the Documentation Website

- After adding your component to the Glitter library, go to demo/
- Find the *template.html* file. Make a copy of it, and rename the copy after your new component.
- On your new html page, fill in all of the necessary fields to fully document your new component. You must include a live demo and a code snippet. Include any additional information you think would be helpful for the user.
- To add your new page to the navigation menu, go to *demo/index.js*. Add your new link to the array of objects called *navLinks*. Please keep the components in alphabetical order.
- Once done, push your changes. Remember to follow our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/glitter/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
